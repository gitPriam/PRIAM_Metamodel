Constraint,Covered,Reasoning
The minor age of the data subject must be between 13 and 16.,Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter II, specifically Article 8. Article 8 of the GDPR addresses the conditions applicable to a child's consent in relation to information society services. It states that where the child is below the age of 16 years, or if provided by Member State law a lower age which shall not be below 13 years, the processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over the child. This article directly addresses the age range of 13 to 16 for minors, making the constraint relevant to GDPR compliance."
A minor data subject must have a guardian (responsible parent).,Yes,"The constraint that a minor data subject must have a guardian (responsible parent) aligns with the requirements of the GDPR, specifically under Chapter II - Principles, Article 8 - Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services."
"The contact details of the control authority must be known to the data subject. There must therefore be exactly one secondary actor whose category is ""supervisory authority"".",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter III, specifically Article 57. Article 57 outlines the tasks of the supervisory authority, which include providing information to data subjects about their rights and obligations under the GDPR. This implies that the contact details of the supervisory authority must be known to the data subject. Additionally, Article 58(1)(a) specifies that the supervisory authority shall provide information to any data subject concerning the exercise of their rights under this Regulation. This ensures that data subjects have access to the necessary information, including contact details, to exercise their rights effectively."
If the country associated with the secondary actor is not adequate then the secondary actor must provide a guarantee.,Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter V, specifically Article 45 and Article 46."
"If the data is personal then the data subject and personal data categories must not be empty the source must not be ""No"" and the data retention period must not be zero.",Yes,"The constraint aligns with several key principles and requirements outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Specifically, it relates to the following chapters and articles:"
"If the data source is ""Direct"" then the data must be portable.",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter III, specifically Article 20, which pertains to the right to data portability."
"If the data source is ""Generated"" then the data must not be portable.",No,"The constraint that ""If the data source is 'Generated' then the data must not be portable"" does not align with any specific GDPR chapter or article. The GDPR, particularly under Chapter III (Rights of the data subject), includes the right to data portability (Article 20). This right allows individuals to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit that data to another controller without hindrance. The constraint that generated data must not be portable directly contradicts this right, as it would restrict the ability of data subjects to exercise their right to data portability."
"If the data source is ""Indirect"" then the source details must be filled in.",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter II, specifically Article 14. Article 14 of the GDPR outlines the information that must be provided to data subjects when personal data has not been obtained directly from them (i.e., indirectly). According to Article 14(1)(f), the controller must provide information about the source of the personal data and, if applicable, whether it came from publicly accessible sources. This directly corresponds to the constraint that if the data source is ""Indirect,"" then the source details must be filled in. Therefore, the constraint is covered by GDPR Chapter II, Article 14."
The modification date (modifiedAt) must be equal to or later than the creation date (createdAt).,No,"The constraint that the modification date (modifiedAt) must be equal to or later than the creation date (createdAt) does not directly align with any specific GDPR chapter or article. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) focuses on the protection of personal data and the rights of individuals regarding their data. It covers principles such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality (Article 5). It also includes obligations related to data subject rights, data protection by design and by default, and accountability."
The end date (endedAt) must be equal to or later than the modification date (modifiedAt).,No,"The constraint that the end date (endedAt) must be equal to or later than the modification date (modifiedAt) does not directly align with any specific GDPR chapter or article. The GDPR primarily focuses on the protection of personal data, including principles such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality. While the constraint ensures data integrity by maintaining logical consistency in date fields, it does not directly address any of the GDPR's core principles or requirements related to data protection. Therefore, no specific GDPR chapter or article explicitly mandates this constraint."
There must be exactly one main purpose in the list of purposes associated with data processing.,No,"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not explicitly require that there must be exactly one main purpose in the list of purposes associated with data processing. Instead, the GDPR emphasizes the importance of having a clear and legitimate purpose for data processing."
"If the processing type (pt) is ""Optional"" or ""Necessary"" then the processing category (pc) must be ""Consent/Contract"".",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter II, specifically Articles 6 and 7."
"If the category of processing (pc) is ""VitalInterest"" ""LegalObligation"" or ""PublicInterest"" then the type of processing (pt) must be ""Mandatory"".",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter II, specifically Articles 6 and 9."
The consent start date must be greater than or equal to the contract signature date and the consent end date must be less than or equal to the contract expiry date.,Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter II, specifically Article 7, which outlines the conditions for consent."
The consent start date must be equal to or later than the processing start date and the consent end date must be equal to or earlier than the processing end date.,Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter II, specifically Article 6 and Article 7."
The date of the response (issuedAt) must be equal to or later than the date of the request (issuedAt).,No,"The constraint that the date of the response (issuedAt) must be equal to or later than the date of the request (issuedAt) does not directly align with any specific GDPR chapter or article. The GDPR primarily focuses on the protection of personal data, the rights of data subjects, and the obligations of data controllers and processors. While timeliness is important in responding to data subject requests (e.g., Article 12 requires that information be provided without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request), the GDPR does not explicitly mandate that the response date must be equal to or later than the request date. This constraint is more of a logical and practical requirement for any request-response system rather than a specific GDPR obligation."
"If the type of data request is ""Rectification"" then the new value (newValue) must not be null.",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter III, specifically Article 16, which pertains to the ""Right to rectification."""
"If the type of data request is ""Deletion"" or ""Rectification"" then there must be exactly one piece of data associated with this request.",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter III, specifically Articles 16 and 17."
If a data request is of type Portability all data included in this request must be marked as portable (isPortable = true).,Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter III, specifically Article 20, which outlines the right to data portability. Article 20 states that data subjects have the right to receive the personal data concerning them, which they have provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This right is intended to facilitate the transfer of personal data from one controller to another, ensuring that the data is portable."
When creating a data request the isPersonal attribute of the associated data must be set to true (data must be personal).,Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter II, specifically Article 4, which defines ""personal data"" and emphasizes the importance of identifying and handling personal data appropriately."
To create a data request (DataRequest) of type Rectification (GDPR right of rectification) the request must first be of this type (precondition). Once the request has been created the isIsolated field is set to true (postcondition) meaning that the data concerned by the request will be isolated.,Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter III, specifically Article 16, which outlines the right to rectification."
In the context of a Breach all data involved must be personal (isPersonal = true). If data is not personal it must not be included in the breach.,Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter II, specifically Article 4, which defines ""personal data"" and ""data breach."""
"If the risk level of the data breach is ""No risk"" then the reasons for non-notification to the data protection authority (sprvAuthNonNotifReasons) and the reasons for non-notification to the data subject (dataSubjNonNotifReasons) must be entered.",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter III, specifically Articles 33 and 34."
"If the risk level of the data breach is ""Medium"" then the reasons for non-notification (dataSubjNonNotifReasons) must be entered.",Yes,"The constraint aligns with the requirements of GDPR Chapter III, specifically Article 33 and Article 34."
