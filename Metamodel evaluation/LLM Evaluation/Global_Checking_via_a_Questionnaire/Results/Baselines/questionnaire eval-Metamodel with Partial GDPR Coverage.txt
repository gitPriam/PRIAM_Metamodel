This question is: Partially modeled

Justification: The question asks whether all transfers are listed, including details such as the nature of the data, the purpose of the processing, the countries involved in the data export and import, and the recipient of the transfer. The metamodel includes the `Country` class, which can represent the countries involved in the data transfer (`countryId`, `name`, `adequate`). However, it lacks classes or attributes to represent the nature of the data, the purpose of the processing, and the recipient of the transfer. These are key concepts that are missing or incomplete in the metamodel.

Question 53: Is there a legal basis for the transfer, e.g. EU Commission adequacy decision; standard contractual clauses. Are these bases documented ?
This question is: Partially modeled

Justification: The question involves two main concepts: the legal basis for data transfer and the documentation of these bases. The metamodel includes the concept of "adequate" in the `Country` class, which can represent whether a country's data protection conditions are equivalent to those of the GDPR. This can be interpreted as a legal basis for data transfer. However, the metamodel does not explicitly represent standard contractual clauses or the documentation of these legal bases. Therefore, key concepts are missing or incomplete.

Question 54: Are data subjects fully informed about any intended international transfers of their personal data ?
This question is: Partially modeled

Justification: The question involves the concept of "data subjects" being informed about "intended international transfers" of their personal data. The metamodel includes the class `Country`, which has an attribute `adequate` that indicates whether personal data protection conditions are equivalent to those offered by the GDPR. This attribute can be used to model the adequacy of data protection in different countries, which is relevant to international transfers. However, the metamodel does not explicitly represent the concept of "data subjects" being informed about these transfers. There is no class or attribute that directly models the notification or information provided to data subjects about international transfers.
