Question 53: Is there a legal basis for the transfer, e.g. EU Commission adequacy decision; standard contractual clauses. Are these bases documented ?
This question is: Partially modeled

Justification: The question involves two main concepts: the legal basis for data transfer and the documentation of these bases. The metamodel includes the concept of "adequate" under the `Country` package, which can represent whether a country's data protection conditions are equivalent to those of the GDPR. This can partially address the legal basis for transfer, such as an EU Commission adequacy decision. However, the metamodel does not include any representation for standard contractual clauses or the documentation of these legal bases.

Question 54: Are data subjects fully informed about any intended international transfers of their personal data ?
This question is: Partially modeled

Justification: The question involves the concept of "international transfers" of personal data and whether data subjects are "fully informed" about these transfers. The metamodel includes the concept of "Country" with an attribute `adequate` that indicates whether personal data protection conditions are equivalent to those offered by the GDPR. This attribute can be used to model the adequacy of data protection in different countries, which is relevant to international transfers. However, the metamodel does not explicitly include concepts related to informing data subjects about these transfers or the process of international data transfers itself. Therefore, key concepts are missing or incomplete.
