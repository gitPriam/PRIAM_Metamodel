This is our metamodel:
[
Animal Interaction Package:

Description,
"Animal: A living organism that is capable of independent movement and is part of the animal kingdom.
animalId: Unique identifier for each animal
species: Species the animal belongs to
name: Animal's given name
birthDate: Date the animal was born
lastCheckupDate: Date of the animal's last health checkup"

Description,
"Enclosure: A designated space or habitat where animals are housed in a zoo, farm, or sanctuary.
enclosureId: Unique identifier for the enclosure
name: Name of the enclosure
type: Type of the enclosure (e.g., aquatic, forest, desert, etc.)
capacity: Maximum number of animals the enclosure can accommodate"

Description,
"Animal Interaction: An event where humans interact with animals, either through observation, care, or other activities.
interactionId: Unique identifier for the interaction
interactionType: Type of interaction (e.g., feeding, training, observation)
interactionDate: Date of the interaction
animalId: The animal involved in the interaction
staffId: The staff member conducting the interaction"

User Stories:

UserStory, "As an [animal caretaker], I want to ensure that animals receive regular health checkups to monitor their well-being."
UserStory, "As an [animal caretaker], I want to keep records of all animal interactions for future reference."
UserStory, "As an [animal caretaker], I want to ensure that the enclosure I manage is safe and meets the needs of the animals living there."
UserStory, "As an [zoo visitor], I want to observe animals in naturalistic environments that reflect their native habitats."
UserStory, "As an [zoo visitor], I want to know the schedule of animal interactions so I can participate or watch them."
UserStory, "As a [staff member], I want to track all interactions with animals to improve animal care and training programs."
UserStory, "As a [zoo manager], I want to track the capacity and utilization of each enclosure to optimize animal welfare."

Associations: These associations are written in plantUML.
Animal "1" -- "0.." Enclosure
Animal "1" -- "0.." Animal Interaction
Enclosure "1" -- "0..*" Animal Interaction

Constraints:

Constraint, "The animal's birth date must be earlier than or equal to the interaction date for any record."
Constraint, "The interaction date must fall within the animal's active period in the enclosure."
Constraint, "Enclosures should not exceed their maximum capacity to ensure the welfare of the animals."
