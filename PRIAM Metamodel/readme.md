**Eclipse Papyrus** is a platform to build UML and SysML-based tools. In our case, we use it to check the validity of our metamodel, and in particular the conformity of OCL constraints.

Papyrus Eclipse can be integrated into the Eclipse environment by installing the Papyrus plugin (via the marketplace) or downloading it from (https://eclipse.dev/papyrus/).

You can import the PRIAM_Metamodel_OCL project to access the metamodel. To check the validity of OCLs, **"right-click on the metamodel in the interface"**, then select **"Validation"** --> **"Validate Model"**.

The list of constraints is available in png format.
